console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size:40px");

/*
"%cHello, World": This is the string that will be logged to the console. The %c is a placeholder that indicates where the CSS styles will be applied.

"color: blue; font-size:40px": This is a string of CSS styles.
The styles are applied at the position of the %c in the previous string.
In this case, the text will be colored blue (color: blue) and will be displayed at a font size of 40 pixels (font-size:40px).

So, when this line of code is executed, "Hello, World" will be printed to the console in blue text with a font size of 40 pixels. 
This feature can be useful for making important log messages stand out,
but it's important to note that it only works in environments that support CSS styling in console messages, such as modern web browsers.
